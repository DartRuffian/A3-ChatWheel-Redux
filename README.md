**Chat Wheel Redux** (_CWR_) is a mostly client-side communication mod, allowing players without the ability to speak to communicate with other players easier. It is primarily intended for mute players who cannot communicate via microphone, but can also assist deaf or hard-of-hearing players if other players also use the mod to help communicate with them.

Chat Wheel Redux is mostly feature complete; however, some of the planned features are: messages when taking damage; when a player is knocked unconcious (ACE); or killed. These will be able to be toggled on or off, similar to the automated messages for throwing grenades functions. They may each recieve their own settings in the future for more customization options.
